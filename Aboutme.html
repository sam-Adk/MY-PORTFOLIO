      <h3>My Little life Experience</h3>
      <p>Ever since my early school days in Kenya, I’ve had an insatiable curiosity for learning—not the kind where you just stare blankly at a book, but a deep, passionate exploration of science, history, and everything in between. While some classmates wondered why I was so obsessed with books and others labeled me a “nerd,” I always balanced my love for learning with a vibrant social life.

High school opened up new worlds for me, both academically and socially. It was there that I first discovered the magic of the computer lab—a place that felt like heaven to me. I knew instantly that technology was my calling. Although circumstances initially diverted my path, my determination never wavered. I graduated with strong grades and went on to pursue an associate degree in business at Mount Kenya University, where I discovered a newfound passion for how businesses operate and grow.

Over the years, I’ve combined my love for learning with practical skills, diving deep into technology through courses in data science, data engineering, data analytics, full-stack web development, cybersecurity, AWS, and more. Today, I’m proud to say I can seamlessly integrate business strategy with technology solutions to help companies thrive in an ever-changing digital world.

Beyond the professional side of life, I’m someone who loves to have fun and experience the world. I dream of traveling, making memories, and forming friendships across the globe. I’m a foodie, a movie enthusiast, and a devoted fan of Billie Eilish.

In short, I’m a lifelong learner, a tech and business enthusiast, and an explorer at heart. I bring passion, creativity, and dedication to every project, and I’m always excited to take on new challenges and opportunities.</p>
