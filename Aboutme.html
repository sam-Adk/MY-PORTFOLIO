      <h3>My Little life Experience</h3>
      <p>Ever since my early school days in Kenya 🇰🇪, I’ve had an insatiable curiosity for learning 📚—not the kind where you just stare blankly at a book, but a deep, passionate exploration of science 🔬, history 🏛️ 🤔, and everything in between. While some classmates wondered why I was so obsessed with books and others labeled me a “nerd” 🤓, I always balanced my love for learning with a vibrant social life 🎉.

High school opened up new worlds for me, both academically and socially 🌟. It was there that I first discovered the magic of the computer lab 💻—a place that felt like heaven to me. I knew instantly that technology was my calling ⚡. Although circumstances initially diverted my path, my determination never wavered 💪. I graduated with strong grades 🏅 and went on to pursue an associate degree in business at Mount Kenya University 🎓, where I discovered a newfound passion for how businesses operate and grow 📈.

Over the years, I’ve combined my love for learning with practical skills, diving deep into technology through courses in data science 📊, data engineering ⚙️, data analytics 📈, full-stack web development 🌐, cybersecurity 🔒, AWS ☁️, and more. Today, I’m proud to say I can seamlessly integrate business strategy with technology solutions to help companies thrive 🚀 in an ever-changing digital world.

Beyond the professional side of life, I’m someone who loves to have fun 😄 and experience the world 🌍. I dream of traveling ✈️, making memories 💖, and forming friendships across the globe 🤝. I’m a foodie 🍕, a movie enthusiast 🎬, and a devoted fan of Billie Eilish 🎶 (yes, obsessed!).

In short, I’m a lifelong learner 📚, a tech and business enthusiast 💻📈, and a fun-loving explorer at heart 🌟. I bring passion, creativity 🎨, and dedication to every project, and I’m always excited to take on new challenges and opportunities 💡.</p>
